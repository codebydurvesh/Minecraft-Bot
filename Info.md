**Data flow per tick:**
1. Safety timer (1 s) → `executor.emergency()` → run if threat/hunger
2. Goal loop → `brain.pickGoal()` → `executor.run(goal)` → `brain.recordOutcome()`
3. Chat event → keyword parser OR LLM → `brain.pushPlayerGoal()`

---

## Entry Point — index.ts

### Purpose
Wires all modules together, starts all timers, handles player chat and CLI commands.

### Key Variables
| Variable | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `running` | boolean | Master on/off switch; `!stop` sets false |
| `emergencyBusy` | boolean | True while emergency goal is executing |
| `goalBusy` | boolean | True while goal loop is executing |

### Timers Started on Spawn
| Timer | Interval | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Safety loop | 1 000 ms | `world.scan()` → `executor.emergency()` → run if non-null |
| Look-at-player | 3 000 ms | Turn head toward nearest player ≤12 m |
| Look-around | 8 000 ms | Random head yaw/pitch (idle animation) |
| Goal loop | continuous (500 ms sleep between goals) | `brain.pickGoal()` → `executor.run()` |

### Inventory Auto-Equip
On every `bot.inventory.updateSlot` event: iterates armor slots 5–8 (head, chest, legs, feet), equips any unequipped armor piece found in inventory.

### Chat Commands (! prefix)
| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `!stop` | Sets `running=false`, bot idles |
| `!start` | Sets `running=true`, resumes goal loop |
| `!status` | Prints `hp`, `food`, `busy` flag |
| `!inv` | Prints first 8 inventory items with counts |
| `!world` | Prints known discovery keys from WorldMemory |
| `!follow` | Pushes `social/follow_trusted` goal directly (bypasses LLM) |

### Attack Detection
Listens to `entityHurt` on the bot entity. Finds the nearest player within 5 m and calls `trust.onAttacked()`.

---

## Bot Creation — bot.ts

### `createBot(cfg)`
- Creates mineflayer bot with `auth: 'offline'`
- Loads `mineflayer-pathfinder` plugin
- Attempts to load `mineflayer-pvp` plugin (optional, falls back gracefully)
- On `spawn`: configures `Movements` — canDig=true, digCost=1, allowSprinting=true, allowParkour=true, blocksCantBreak={bedrock, obsidian}
- If `cfg.password` is set: sends `/register <pw> <pw>` then `/login <pw>` with delays
- On `death`: calls `(bot as any).respawn()` and then `/grave` after 3 s (to recover items from grave plugins)
- Handles `error`, `end`, `kicked` events with log output

---

## LLM Client — llm.ts

### `OllamaClient`
| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `ping()` | GET `/api/tags`, checks model exists, returns bool |
| `chat(messages, format?)` | POST `/api/chat`, stream=false, returns content string |
| `getModel()` | Returns model name string |

### Inference Settings
```
temperature: 0.15    ← low = deterministic, less hallucination
num_predict: 80      ← max tokens per response
repeat_penalty: 1.1  ← reduces repetition
```

### Format Parameter
Passing `'json'` to `chat()` enables Ollama JSON mode — model is forced to output valid JSON.

---

## Brain — brain.ts (Decision Maker)

### `Brain` — The core intelligence

#### `pickGoal()` — 4-tier priority cascade

```
Tier 0: Player goals (pushPlayerGoal queue)    ← highest priority
Tier 1: deterministicGoal()                    ← inventory-aware rules
Tier 2: Strategy queue (STRATEGIES[phase])     ← phase progression
Tier 3: llmGoal()  (rate-limited 15s)          ← Ollama fallback
Tier 4: fallback()                             ← always returns something
```

#### Phase Detection
| Phase | Condition |
|---|---|
| `early_game` | Default; no iron pickaxe or not full iron armor |
| `mid_game` | Stone pickaxe (tier ≥ 1) AND furnace in inv or world |
| `late_game` | Iron pickaxe (tier ≥ 2) AND full iron armor |

Phase change triggers a fresh strategy queue from `STRATEGIES[phase]`.

#### `deterministicGoal()` — 14-step priority waterfall
Each step returns a Goal or falls through to the next:

| Step | Condition | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Unequipped armor in inventory | `survive/equip_armor` |
| 1a | Hostile ≤16 m + can fight | `combat/nearest` |
| 1b | Hostile + low HP or ≤5 m | `survive/flee` |
| 2a | HP ≤10, no hostile, has food | `survive/eat` |
| 2b | Food ≤6 | `survive/eat` |
| 2c | Food ≤14 and HP <18, has food | `survive/eat` |
| 3 | Night + has bed or knows bed location | `survive/sleep` |
| 3b | Night + no bed + enough wool+planks | `craft/white_bed` |
| 3c | Night + no bed + not enough wool | `hunt/sheep` |
| 4 | No logs AND no planks | `gather/wood` |
| 5 | No crafting table (inv or world) | `craft/crafting_table` or `gather/wood` |
| 6 | No pickaxe at all (tier=-1) | `craft/wooden_pickaxe` or `gather/wood` |
| 7 | No sword at all | `craft/wooden_sword` or `gather/wood` |
| 8 | Only wooden pickaxe (tier=0) | `craft/stone_pickaxe` or `gather/stone` |
| 9 | No food | `hunt/cow` |
| 10 | No furnace (inv or world) | `craft/furnace` or `gather/stone` |
| 11 | No coal/charcoal | `gather/coal` |
| 12 | No iron pickaxe (tier<2) | `craft/iron_pickaxe` or `smelt/iron_ingot` or `explore/iron_ore` |
| 13 | Iron sword tier <2 + enough ingots | `craft/iron_sword` |
| 14 | Missing iron armor piece + enough ingots | `craft/<piece>` or smelt/explore |

#### Loop Suppression
- Tracks fail timestamps in `failHistory` (120 s window)
- If same goal+target fails **3 times** → suppressed for **90 s**
- Suppressed goals are skipped at all tiers
- Successful gather wood un-suppresses all dependent craft goals

#### `fleeSafeUntil`
After a successful flee, blocks `survive/flee` for **30 s** to prevent flee loops.

#### LLM Prompt Contents
Sent to Ollama every ≥15 s when tiers 0–2 yield nothing:
```
phase, hp, food, time, y-level, armed/unarmed, pickaxe_tier
nearby entities (with ! prefix for hostiles)
inventory (first 15 items)
craftable_now (items bot can craft right now)
has_bed
learned (last 5 outcomes from LearningMemory)
known (discovered locations summary)
```

#### `alreadyAchieved()` — skip redundant strategy goals
- Pickaxe/sword: skips if current tier ≥ target tier
- Axe: skips if any axe present
- Gather: skips if count ≥ threshold (wood=16, stone=16, coal=8, iron=12, food=8)

#### `canAttempt()` — prerequisite gates
- `gather/stone`, `gather/coal`: need pickaxe tier ≥ 0
- `gather/iron`: need pickaxe tier ≥ 1
- `gather/diamond`: need pickaxe tier ≥ 2
- `craft/*`: need planks/logs for wood tools; cobblestone for stone tools; crafting table for 3×3 recipes

---

## Executor — executor.ts

### `run(goal: Goal)`
Dispatches to the appropriate goal module. Records outcome to `LearningMemory` including:
- goal, target, success, duration (ms)
- items gained (map of name→count)
- timeOfDay ('day'/'night')
- nearbyThreats (hostile names within 16 m)

### `emergency(): Goal | null`
Pure code — no LLM. Checked every 1 s by the safety timer.

| Condition | Goal |
|---|---|
| HP ≤ 4 | `survive/flee` — critical health |
| Food ≤ 6 | `survive/eat` — starving |
| HP ≤ 14 AND food ≤ 14 | `survive/eat` — eat to heal |
| Hostile ≤ 5 m + has weapon + HP > 6 | `combat/nearest` |
| Hostile ≤ 5 m + no weapon | `survive/flee` |

---

## Goal: Survive — goals/survive.ts

### `executeSurvive(bot, target)`
Dispatcher to sub-functions.

### `eat(bot)`
- Skips if food ≥ 16
- Calls `getBestFood(bot)` to pick highest-value food item
- `bot.equip(food, 'hand')` → `bot.consume()`

### `flee(bot)`
- Gets all hostiles within 24 m
- Computes average direction away from all hostiles (vector sum)
- Sprints 32 m in that direction using `navigateTo()`
- Returns success=true only if 0 hostiles remain within 24 m after fleeing

### `sleepInBed(bot)`
4-step process:
1. If bed item in inventory → call `placeBedNearby()` → sleep in placed bed
2. Check for existing bed ≤ 16 m → navigate → `bot.sleep()`
3. If wool ≥ 3 + planks ≥ 3 → craft `white_bed` → place it
4. Fail with reason string

**Conditions for sleep:** Must be night (`12542 < timeOfDay < 23460`), no hostiles within 12 m.

### `equipBestArmour(bot)`
- Checks 4 armor slots (5=head, 6=torso, 7=legs, 8=feet)
- For each slot, picks the best tier available from inventory
- Priority per slot: netherite > diamond > iron > golden > chainmail > leather
- Only equips if inventory item is better tier than currently equipped

### `checkHealth(bot)`
- If HP ≤ 10 + hostiles nearby → flee
- Else if food < 16 → eat
- Else → healthy, return success

---

## Goal: Gather — goals/gather.ts

### `executeGather(bot, target)`

**Target → Block names mapping** (via `BLOCK_ALIASES`):
- `wood` → all `*_log` variants
- `stone` → cobblestone, stone, deepslate variants
- `coal` → coal_ore, deepslate_coal_ore
- `iron` → iron_ore, deepslate_iron_ore, raw_iron
- `diamond` → diamond_ore, deepslate_diamond_ore
- etc.

**Target counts** (stops mining once reached):
- wood: 16, stone: 24, all others: 8

**Algorithm:**
1. `scanForBlocks()` — finds up to 10 nearest matching blocks within 64 m
2. Tracks `triedPositions` set to avoid retrying same block
3. Expands to 128 m if nothing found at 64 m
4. `equipToolForBlock()` — equips correct tool; skips block if tool required but missing
5. For tree logs: uses `y=null` in `navigateTo()` (GoalXZ — doesn't try to climb)
6. `bot.dig(block, true)` — instant-dig flag
7. `collectNearbyDrops()` — navigates to item entities within 10 m

**navFails counter:** Stops early if ≥ 4 consecutive navigation failures.

**Tool requirement:**
- Stone/ores: must have pickaxe or block won't drop
- Wood/sand/dirt: tool optional (mines slower by hand)

---

## Goal: Craft/Smelt — goals/craft.ts

### `executeCraft(bot, target, quantity=1)`

**Already have check:** Returns success immediately if `countOf(bot, target) >= quantity`.

**Smelting targets** (handled differently from crafting):
| Target | Input | Default Fuel |
|---|---|---|
| `iron_ingot` | raw_iron | coal |
| `gold_ingot` | raw_gold | coal |
| `charcoal` | any *_log | any *_log |
| `cooked_beef` | beef | coal |
| `cooked_porkchop` | porkchop | coal |
| `cooked_chicken` | chicken | coal |
| `cooked_mutton` | mutton | coal |

Fuel fallback order: coal → charcoal → any log

**Pre-craft wood processing:**
If bot has logs: auto-converts logs→planks (up to 12), then makes sticks (up to 8) before attempting any craft.

**3-step craft attempt:**
1. `bot.recipesFor(id, null, 1, null)` — try 2×2 (no table needed)
2. `getCraftingTable()` — find/place crafting table
3. `bot.recipesFor(id, null, 1, ctBlock)` — try 3×3 with table

### `getCraftingTable(bot)`
1. Find within 6 m → navigate → return
2. Place from inventory if available
3. If no table in inventory: `convertLogsToPlanks(4)` → craft 2×2 → place

### `getFurnace(bot)`
1. Find within 16 m → navigate → return
2. Place from inventory if available

### `smelt(bot, input, fuel, quantity)`
- Gets/places furnace
- `openFurnace()` → `putFuel()` → `putInput()`
- Waits up to `min(count × 12 000ms, 90 000ms)`
- Polls `outputItem().count` every 2 s
- `takeOutput()` → `furnace.close()`

### `convertLogsToPlanks(bot, needed)`
Converts any inventory log type to its matching planks. Handles all wood types dynamically via `bot.recipesFor()`.

### `ensureSticks(bot, needed)`
Converts planks → sticks as needed.

### `listCraftable(bot)` (exported utility)
Returns array of craftable item names given current inventory.

---

## Goal: Explore — goals/explore.ts

### `executeExplore(bot, target, world)`

**If target has known position in WorldMemory:**
- Navigate to it if dist > 20 m
- On arrival: `world.scan()` + `lootNearbyChests()`

**Strategy selection:**
- Ore targets (coal_ore, iron_ore, gold_ore, diamond_ore) → `deepDig()`
- Everything else (village, cave, any, etc.) → `surfaceScan()`

### `surfaceScan(bot, target, world)`
- Picks an unexplored destination 80–160 m away
- `isExplored()` grid: 64×64 block cells tracked in memory
- Navigates there, marks explored, scans world, loots chests
- Reports found/not-found

### `deepDig(bot, target, world)`
Target Y levels:
| Ore | Target Y |
|---|---|
| coal_ore | 64 |
| iron_ore | 16 |
| copper_ore | 48 |
| gold_ore | -16 |
| diamond_ore | -58 |

- Navigates to target Y if >8 blocks away
- Places torches if underground and dark
- Digs a branch tunnel 24 m in random direction
- Scans world at each point

### `lootNearbyChests(bot, world)`
- Finds up to 3 chests within 24 m
- Opens each, takes only items in `USEFUL` whitelist (iron, diamonds, food, weapons, armor, etc.)
- Records chest position in WorldMemory

### `collectNearbyDrops(bot)`
Navigates to up to 4 item entities within 8 m.

### `placeTorchIfDark(bot)`
Below y=50: checks light level, places torch from inventory if ≤7.

---

## Goal: Farm/Hunt — goals/farm.ts

### `executeFarm(bot, target)`
Valid targets: cow, sheep, chicken, pig, hunt (any food mob)

**Hunt loop:**
1. `getNearestPassive(bot, mobNames, 96)` — finds mob within 96 m
2. Equips best sword
3. `navigateTo()` within 2 m
4. Attack loop: up to 10 hits with 500 ms cooldown between each
5. Collect item drops within 10 m
6. Repeats up to 3× (sheep) or 4× (others) per goal call

**Post-hunt cooking:** `tryCookMeat()` — if raw meat + fuel + furnace available:
- Opens furnace, puts fuel and raw meat in
- Waits up to `min(count × 12 000ms, 60 000ms)`
- Takes cooked output

---

## Goal: Combat — goals/combat.ts

### `executeCombat(bot, target)`

**Target `'nearest'`:** Finds closest hostile within 16 m, sorted by distance.
**Target `'<mobName>'`:** Filters to that mob type within 16 m.

**Weapon selection:** `getBestTool(bot, 'sword')` first, then axe. Returns failure if no weapon.

**Shield:** Auto-equips off-hand shield when fighting skeleton, stray, pillager, or blaze.

**Melee loop (max 30 s):**
1. Check if mob is dead → collect drops → return success
2. Check HP ≤ 6 → sprint away 24 m → return `disengaged`
3. If dist > 3.5 m → `GoalFollow(mob, 2)` pathfinder
4. Attack with 600 ms cooldown

**Creeper special (`fightCreeper()`):**
- Hit at ≤3.5 m → immediately sprint 6 m away
- Repeat up to 15 s
- Prevents creeper explosion (hit-and-run)

### `shouldFight(bot)` — exported helper
Returns true if bot has sword OR axe AND HP > 6.
Used by Brain and Executor to decide fight vs flee.

---

## Goal: Social — goals/social.ts

### `executeSocial(bot, target, trust)`

**`target='greet'`:** Sends random greeting string to chat, increments trust for all online players.

**`target='flee_threat'`:** Finds trust-threat players (<0.25 score) within 20 m, runs opposite direction for 5 s.

**`target='follow_trusted'` or `'follow'`:**
- Picks nearest non-threat player (falls back to any player if all are threats)
- `GoalFollow(entity, 3)` with `dynamic=true` so pathfinder re-routes as player moves
- Polls every 500 ms for 30 s, refreshes entity reference each tick
- Stops if player disconnects

**`target='follow:<Name>'`:** Follows specific named player for 20 s.

---

## Goal: Build — goals/build.ts

### `executeBuild(bot, target)`
If target not in structures dictionary → falls back to `executeCraft(bot, target)`.

### Built-in Structures

**`shelter`:** 5×5 wooden shelter, 3 blocks tall, oak_planks walls + roof, door gap at x=2 z=0 y=0–1, 2 torches inside.

**`chest_room`:** 3×3 cobblestone platform with a row of 3 chests on top.

**`furnace_station`:** 3 cobblestone base blocks, furnace at x=0, crafting_table at x=1, furnace at x=2.

### Build Process
1. `findFlatSite(bot, w, d, radius=24)` — scans for flat 5×5 air+solid area
2. `prepareMaterials()` — tallies needed items → calls `ensureItem()` for each
3. `buildStructure()` — sorts blocks bottom-up, navigates to each, `placeBlock()`
4. `placeBlock()` — tries 6 adjacent faces for a solid surface to place against

---

## Goal: Chat — goals/chat.ts

### `parseChatIntent(llm, username, message, botContext)`

**Two-stage parsing:**
1. **Keyword parser** (runs first, no LLM cost) — regex matches on lowercase message
2. **LLM parser** — only called if keyword parser returns null

### Keyword Parser Coverage
| Pattern | Goal/Target |
|---|---|
| follow/come here | social/follow_trusted |
| stop/halt/freeze | null (no goal) |
| get/gather/chop + wood/log/tree | gather/wood |
| get/mine/gather + stone/cobble | gather/stone |
| get/mine + iron | gather/iron |
| get/mine + coal | gather/coal |
| get/mine + diamond | gather/diamond |
| hunt/kill/get + cow/beef/steak | hunt/cow |
| hunt/kill/get + sheep/wool | hunt/sheep |
| hunt/kill/get + chicken | hunt/chicken |
| hunt/kill/get + pig/pork | hunt/pig |
| explore/wander/roam | explore/any |
| find + village/town | explore/village |
| find + cave | explore/cave |
| fight/attack + mob/zombie/skeleton | combat/nearest |
| craft/make + pickaxe | craft/wooden|stone|iron_pickaxe |
| craft/make + sword | craft/wooden|stone|iron_sword |
| craft/make + furnace | craft/furnace |
| craft/make + bed | craft/white_bed |
| smelt/cook + iron | smelt/iron_ingot |
| build/make + shelter/house/base | build/shelter |
| sleep/rest/go to bed | survive/sleep |
| what are you doing / status | question (no goal) |

### `intentToGoal(intent)` → `Goal | null`
Validates goal type against VALID_GOALS set before casting.

### Proactive Chat (`proactiveChat()`)
- 30 s cooldown between messages
- Only fires if players are online
- Announces current activity (chopping trees, mining coal, etc.)

### `buildBotContext(bot)` — context string for LLM
Returns: `hp=X/20 food=Y/20 time=day|night pos=(x,y,z) inventory=[...]`

---

## Memory: Learning — memory/learning.ts

### `LearningMemory`
Ring buffer of up to 500 `LearningEntry` records, persisted to `data/learning.json`.

### Key Methods
| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `record(entry)` | Appends entry, updates stats, triggers debounced save (2 s) |
| `getScore(goal, target)` | EWMA success rate 0–1 (0.5 if <2 attempts) |
| `isSuppressed(goal, target)` | True if failed ≥3 times in 5 min window (suppressed 3 min) |
| `lastThree(n=5)` | Compact string: `gather(wood)✓ craft(crafting_table)✗` |
| `successRate(goal)` | Overall success % for a goal type |
| `efficiency(goal, target)` | Items/minute for gather/hunt goals |
| `recentAttempts(goal, target, window)` | Count of attempts in time window |
| `summary()` | `wins:...  | avoid:...` for LLM prompt |

### EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average)
`alpha=0.3` — recent results count more than old ones.
Formula: `ewma = 0.3 * result + 0.7 * previous_ewma`

### Suppression Logic
- Window: 5 min (300 000 ms)
- Threshold: 3 failures within window
- Cooldown: 3 min (180 000 ms)
- Note: This is **separate** from Brain's own suppression — both run in parallel.

---

## Memory: Trust — memory/trust.ts

### `TrustMemory`
Persisted to `data/trust.json`. Per-player profile with trust score 0–1.

### Score Changes
| Event | Delta |
|---|---|
| Attacked bot | -0.40 |
| Gave item | +0.15 |
| Chat message | +0.01 |

### Thresholds
| Method | Threshold | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `isTrusted(u)` | score > 0.65 | Safe to interact with |
| `isThreat(u)` | score < 0.25 | Actively hostile player |

**Default starting score:** 0.7 (friendly by default — can follow, interact freely)
One attack drops to 0.3 (no longer trusted, not yet threat threshold).
Two attacks drop to ~0.0 (hard threat).

---

## Memory: World — memory/world.ts

### `WorldMemory`
Persisted to `data/world.json`. Stores up to 5 discoveries per location type.

### Discovery Keys
| Key | How Discovered |
|---|---|
| `village` | ≥3 villager entities nearby |
| `chest` | `findBlock` within 24 m |
| `furnace` | `findBlock` within 24 m |
| `crafting_table` | `findBlock` within 24 m |
| `smithing_table` | `findBlock` within 24 m |
| `enchanting_table` | `findBlock` within 24 m |
| `bed` | Any bed block within 48 m |
| `cave_entrance` | Bot's position when y < 50 |

### Key Methods
| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `scan(bot)` | Runs all detection logic above |
| `discover(name, pos)` | Adds discovery if not already within 10 blocks |
| `getNearest(name)` | Returns most recently discovered position for key |
| `getNearestTo(name, pos)` | Returns position nearest to given coordinates |
| `knows(name)` | Returns true if any discovery exists for key |
| `summary()` | First 8 known keys as comma string |

---

## Navigation — utils/navigation.ts

### `navigateTo(bot, x, y|null, z, reach=2, timeoutMs=30000)`
- `y=null` → uses `GoalXZ` (ignores height — good for tree logs)
- `y=number` → uses `GoalNear(x,y,z,reach)`
- **Adaptive timeout:** `max(timeoutMs, min(dist×500, 90000))` — far targets get more time

### Stuck Detection
- Checks every 2 500 ms
- "Stuck" = moved < 0.1 blocks since last check
- After 5 stuck checks (12.5 s) → attempts recovery
- Max 4 recovery attempts before giving up

### Recovery Strategies (cycled)
| Attempt | Strategy |
|---|---|
| 0 | Jump + random strafe (forward/back/left/right) |
| 1 | Dig front-facing block at eye, foot, or below-foot level |
| 2 | Sprint backward + jump for 900 ms |
| 3 | Dig block below bot → jump |

### `goToBlock(bot, block, reach=2)`
Convenience wrapper around `navigateTo()` using block.position.

### `wander(bot, radius=20, attempts=5)`
Tries up to 5 random points within radius. Useful as last-resort unstick.

### `lookAround(bot)`
Adds random yaw (±π) and small pitch variation to current head angle.

### `lookAtNearestPlayer(bot, range=16)`
Turns to look at nearest player's head position.

### Movement Settings Applied per `navigateTo()` call
```
allowSprinting = true
canDig = true
digCost = 2
maxDropDown = 4
allow1by1towers = true
```

## ⚠️ Logic Errors & Bugs

These are confirmed issues that make the bot less smart, less responsive, or cause it to fail.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL BUG #1 — Emergency blocked during long goals
**File:** `index.ts` — Safety loop  
**Code:**
```typescript
setInterval(async () => {
  if (!running || emergencyBusy || goalBusy) return;  // ← BUG HERE
  ...emergency check...
}, cfg.safetyTickMs);
```
**Problem:** When `goalBusy=true` (bot is smelting, exploring, building — which can take up to 90 s), the emergency check is completely **skipped**. The bot can die from a creeper explosion or starve while waiting for furnace output.

**Fix:**
```typescript
setInterval(async () => {
  if (!running || emergencyBusy) return;  // Remove || goalBusy
  world.scan(bot);
  const emergency = executor.emergency();
  if (!emergency) return;

  emergencyBusy = true;
  // Signal goal loop to stop current goal
  const prevGoalBusy = goalBusy;
  // Run emergency regardless of goal state
  try {
    const result = await executor.run(emergency);
    brain.recordOutcome(emergency.goal, emergency.target, result.success, result.reason);
  } catch (e: any) {
    log.error(`Emergency error: ${e.message}`);
  } finally {
    emergencyBusy = false;
  }
}, cfg.safetyTickMs);
```
This is the **#1 reason the bot keeps dying and failing** — it cannot react to threats or hunger while any goal is running.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL BUG #2 — `GOAL_TICK_MS` env var is read but never used
**File:** `index.ts`  
**Code:**
```typescript
goalTickMs: Number(process.env.GOAL_TICK_MS ?? 8000),  // stored in cfg
// ...
// Goal loop only has:
await sleep(500);  // cfg.goalTickMs is NEVER referenced
```
**Problem:** The goal loop runs every ~500 ms between goals regardless of `GOAL_TICK_MS=8000`. This means the bot cycles through goals much faster than intended and can spam the same goal repeatedly within seconds.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// In goal loop:
await sleep(cfg.goalTickMs);  // use the configured value
```

---

### 🟠 SERIOUS BUG #3 — `smelt()` blocks for up to 90 s with goalBusy=true
**File:** `goals/craft.ts` — `smelt()` function  
**Code:**
```typescript
while (Date.now() - start < Math.min(count * 12_000, 90_000)) {
  await sleep(2_000);
  ...
}
```
**Problem:** Combined with Bug #1, the bot can be locked in smelting for up to 90 seconds with no emergency response possible.

**Fix:** Add a per-iteration emergency check inside the smelt loop, or break out early when the executor signals an interrupt. Minimum fix: reduce max smelt wait to 30 s and handle the partial output.

---

### 🟠 SERIOUS BUG #4 — `tryCookMeat()` fuel calculation is wrong
**File:** `goals/farm.ts`  
**Code:**
```typescript
const cookCount = Math.min(rawMeat.count, fuelItem.count * 2);
```
**Problem:** Assumes each fuel item smelts 2 items. Coal actually smelts **8** items. This puts far too much fuel into the furnace and wastes coal.

**Fix:**
```typescript
const FUEL_SMELT_COUNT: Record<string, number> = {
  coal: 8, charcoal: 8, oak_log: 1.5, // etc.
};
const smeltsPerFuel = FUEL_SMELT_COUNT[fuelName] ?? 1;
const cookCount = Math.min(rawMeat.count, Math.floor(fuelItem.count * smeltsPerFuel));
```

---

### 🟡 MODERATE BUG #5 — Flee cooldown can block flee when still in danger
**File:** `brain.ts`  
**Code:**
```typescript
if (Date.now() > this.fleeSafeUntil)
  return { goal: 'survive', target: 'flee', reason: ... };
```
**Problem:** After a successful flee, `fleeSafeUntil` blocks flee for 30 s. If the bot wanders back into the same hostile area within 30 s (which explore/gather will do), it won't flee again.

**Fix:** Only set `fleeSafeUntil` if the bot has actually moved significantly away from the danger, OR set the cooldown much shorter (5 s).

---

### 🟡 MODERATE BUG #6 — `deterministicGoal` step 4 only triggers on ZERO wood
**File:** `brain.ts`
```typescript
if (!hasAnyLogs(this.bot) && !hasAnyPlanks(this.bot))
  return { goal: 'gather', target: 'wood', reason: 'no wood at all' };
```
**Problem:** Bot won't proactively gather wood unless completely out. If it has 1 plank left, it won't refill. The `alreadyAchieved` threshold (16 logs) handles the ceiling but there's no floor — the bot may try to craft a pickaxe with 1 plank and fail.

**Fix:** Add a low-stock gather step: if logs < 4 AND planks < 8, gather wood.

---

### 🟡 MODERATE BUG #7 — Strategy queue depletes without refilling
**File:** `brain.ts` — `pickGoal()`  
**Problem:** Strategy queue items are `shift()`ed off and never re-added. Once a phase's strategy queue is empty (all goals achieved or skipped), the bot immediately falls to the LLM tier (rate-limited to 15 s). If LLM also fails or is suppressed, it hits the fallback and wanders. The queue is only reset on a phase transition.

**Fix:** In `pickGoal()`, after the strategy queue is empty, rebuild it from unachieved goals before going to LLM:
```typescript
if (this.strategyQueue.length === 0) {
  this.strategyQueue = STRATEGIES[this.currentPhase]
    .filter(g => !this.alreadyAchieved(g) && !this.isSuppressed(g.goal, g.target) && this.canAttempt(g));
}
```

---

### 🟡 MODERATE BUG #8 — `noPath` in navigation resolves too late
**File:** `utils/navigation.ts`  
**Code:**
```typescript
function onPathUpdate(r: any) {
  if (r.status === 'noPath') {
    if (unstickCount >= 2) {
      cleanup(); resolve(false);
    }
  }
}
```
**Problem:** On the first `noPath`, nothing happens — the bot just keeps trying. This wastes time (up to the full timeout) when the path is genuinely blocked.

**Fix:** On first `noPath`, immediately try `wander()` to reposition, then retry pathfinding once. On second `noPath`, give up.

---

### 🟡 MODERATE BUG #9 — `build.ts` has its own `navigateTo()` with only 10 s timeout
**File:** `goals/build.ts`  
**Code:**
```typescript
const NAV_TIMEOUT_MS = 10_000;
async function navigateTo(bot, x, y, z, reach = 2): Promise<boolean> { ... }
```
**Problem:** This is a completely different (simplified) `navigateTo` from `utils/navigation.ts`. It lacks the stuck recovery logic and adaptive timeout. Build goals will fail navigation far more often than other goals.

**Fix:** Import and use `navigateTo` from `utils/navigation.ts` instead.

---

### 🟡 MODERATE BUG #10 — `craft.ts` is duplicated
**Problem:** Files `src/goals/craft.ts` appears twice with identical content. This is a copy-paste artifact in the provided code. Ensure only one canonical version exists in the project.

---

### 🟢 MINOR BUG #11 — LearningMemory suppression duplicates Brain suppression
**Files:** `memory/learning.ts` + `brain.ts`  
**Problem:** Both `Brain` (3-fail/120 s window) and `LearningMemory` (3-fail/5 min window) maintain independent suppression lists. The Brain checks its own `isSuppressed()` but never checks `learning.isSuppressed()`. The two systems can produce different suppression states.

**Fix:** Either remove suppression from `LearningMemory` and rely only on Brain's, or have Brain check both:
```typescript
private isSuppressed(goal: string, target: string): boolean {
  return this._isSupressed(goal, target) || this.learning.isSuppressed(goal, target);
}
```

---

### 🟢 MINOR BUG #12 — `qwen2.5:1.5b` is too small for reliable JSON output
**Problem:** A 1.5B parameter model struggles to reliably produce valid JSON goal decisions. The keyword parser mitigates this for common commands, but novel situations still fall through to the LLM and may produce invalid goals (e.g. `"goal":"forage"` which is rejected).

**Recommendation:** Use `qwen2.5:7b` or `llama3.2:3b` for more reliable JSON. Both run on consumer hardware.

---

### 🟢 MINOR BUG #13 — Sleep in `bot.ts` auth sequence not long enough on slow servers
**Code:**
```typescript
await sleep(2000);
bot.chat(`/register ${cfg.password} ${cfg.password}`);
await sleep(1500);
bot.chat(`/login ${cfg.password}`);
```
**Problem:** On some servers the initial spawn + plugin load takes longer than 2 s. The `/register` fires before the server sends the auth prompt and gets ignored.

**Fix:** Wait for a chat message from the server containing "register" or "login" before responding, or increase delays to 3000/2000.

---

## Improvement Recommendations

### High Impact
1. **Fix Bug #1 (emergency blocking)** — this alone will dramatically improve survival rate
2. **Fix Bug #2 (GOAL_TICK_MS)** — prevents goal spam and CPU thrashing
3. **Upgrade LLM model** — `qwen2.5:7b` is much more reliable; use `qwen2.5:1.5b` only for speed

### Medium Impact
4. **Add `isInterrupted` flag to long-running goals** — lets emergency signal them to abort early
5. **Add `gather/food` target** — currently bot hunts cows specifically; a generic food target could forage apples, bread from villages, etc.
6. **Cache `minecraft-data` require** — every goal file does `require('minecraft-data')(bot.version)` on every call. Cache it module-level for performance.
7. **Pathfinder goal replacement** — when following a moving target, use `GoalFollow` not repeated `GoalNear` calls, which causes stuttering

### Low Impact / Quality of Life
8. **Add `!goals` command** — print current strategy queue and suppressed goals for debugging
9. **Add `!brain` command** — show current phase and last 5 decisions
10. **Increase `num_predict` to 120** — the LLM sometimes cuts off JSON mid-stream at 80 tokens
11. **Add `!suppress` and `!unsuppress` commands** — for manual debugging of stuck loops
12. **World scan on `goal_reached`** — currently only scans on safety tick; scanning after each nav arrival catches more discoveries
13. **Add crafting table world discovery** — currently Brain checks `world.knows('crafting_table')` but `WorldMemory.scan()` only scans within 24 m. Place crafting table in world scan and increase radius to 32 m.
